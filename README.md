# Machine Learning and Neural Networks
This code was built with the idea of creating a model that can predict whether Alphabet Soup(a venture capital firm) funding applicants will be successful, I created a binary classification model using a deep neural network. The code was started with a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. 


## Technologies

```

## Installation

In order to open and run this program you have to follow these steps:

* Go to my repository in GitHub and open the repository called ```machine_learning_and_neural_networks_13```

* Copy the repository's link.

* Open Git Bash in your computer.

![git_bash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80844686/115638940-40d82c80-a2c8-11eb-816a-e991b245cd88.jpg)

* Clone the repository by typing ```git clone``` and paste the link ```git@github.com:nestor39/machine_learning_and_neural_networks_13.git```.

After doing the steps above you are going to have the files in your computer, now we are going to need to open it:

 * Open Git Bash in your computer.
  
  * Activate  the Conda development environment, by typing ```conda activate dev```.
    * Install tensorflow ```pip install --upgrade tensorflow```.
    * Verify if Keras package is available ```python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"```.
  
 * Type  ```jupyter lab"``` in your Git Bash(it will open a tab in your explorer).
  
 * Open the file ```venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb``` and you are going to be able to see the code.
  
  * Run the code.
